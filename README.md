# ImageJ

This is a collection of scripts/macros that can be used with the `Fiji ImageJ` software. The language in which they are found is the specific one for this software, Java-like, it is called ImageJ Macro Language (IJM)

This series of scripts was created to analyze microscopy images containing between one and 3 color channels. The file titles are descriptive enough to make the scripts easy to use.
